            <div class="p-5 bg-body-tertiary rounded-3 shadow-sm">
                <p class="lead mb-4">This is what I do.</p>

                <p>I am a Legacy Application Developer with more than 11 years of professional experience building and
                    enhancing enterprise systems. I enjoy solving complex problems through clean code and thoughtful
                    design.</p>

                <p>My curiosity keeps me learning, which recently inspired me to dive into Python. I use it to
                    experiment with automation ideas, personal tools and projects that push me beyond my Mainframe
                    background. BreakTime Stories is one of those projects. I designed and built this blog myself using
                    Python, Flask and Jinja, turning our break-time conversations about current affairs, cinema,
                    sports and everything in between into a space where those stories can live and grow.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I like to keep life active and interesting. You will often find me playing cricket,
                    badminton, volleyball or heading out for a cycling session on weekends. I am a firm believer in
                    balancing tech with time outdoors.</p>

                <p>I enjoy reading nonfiction, especially biographies and books that teach me something new about the
                    real world. I also love watching documentaries, feel good movies, action films and sci-fi stories
                    that spark imagination and inspiration.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">I approach everything with a mindset of continuous improvement. Learning new skills,
                    staying physically active and exploring creative hobbies all help me become a better version of
                    myself, one step at a time!</p>
